      dot chaining
        rxjs style, pipeline like
      contrast: imperative style
        every line is disconnected
        introducing states
      major contributor to complexity: handling of state
      second: control flow
      third: code size
      dot chaining:
        no control flow, no state
      programming is not math
      function composition
        f . g = x => f(g(x))
      dot chaining is function composition
        str
          .toUpperCase().trim()
        trim(toUpperCase(str))
      we can use math to learn programming
        category theory:
          theory of composition / arrows
      a -> b -> c
        |> F(a) -> F(b) -> F(c)

        ex
          const contrivedEx1 = str => { 
            const trimmed = str.trim()
            const number = parseInt(trimmed)
            const nextNumber = number + 1
            return String.fromCharCode(nextNumber)
          }
          contrivedEx1(' 64 ' )
        how to dot chain this?
        we put str.trim() into a box
        ex
          const contrivedEx1 = str => 
            [str.trim()]
            .map( trimmed => parseInt(trimmed) )
            .map( number => number + 1 )
            .map( nextNumber => String.fromCharCode(nextNumber))
          }
        ex: use Box
          const Box = x => ({ 
            map: f => Box(f(x)),
            fold: f => f(x)
          })
          const contrivedEx1 = str => 
            Box(str.trim())
            .map( trimmed => parseInt(trimmed) )
            .map( number => number + 1 )
            .fold( nextNumber => String.fromCharCode(nextNumber))
          }
          contrivedEx1(' 64 ' ) // 'A'
      what did we do?
        unified call syntax
        minimized state
        captured assignment
        forced control flow
      complexity causes:  
        assignment +
        loops
        callbacks
        side effects
        branching
        errors
      loops:
        solution: map, filter, reduce
        how to deal with while loops?
          unfold
          ex
            const range = (i, count) =>
              unfold( x => if(x <= count) [x, x+1], i)
            range(5,10)
            // [5,6,7,8,9,10]
      callbacks:
        solution: Promise
        ex:
          Promise(6).then(six => six / 2)
          // Promise(3)
          Promise(6).map(six => six/2)
          // Promise(3)
          Promise(6).chain(six => Promise(six/2))
          // Promise(3)
        ex:
          /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-102.png
          -->
          const readFile = futurize(fs.readFile) 
          const writeFile = futurize(fs.writeFile)
          const contrivedEx2 = () =>
            readFile(cfg.json', 'utf-8')
            .map(contents => contents.replace(/8/g, '6'))
            .chain(replaced => writeFile('cfg1.json', replaced))
          contrivedEx2().fork(e => console.error(e),
            r => console.log('success'))
        ex:
          const lib = username =>
            getTweets(username)
            .map(ts => truncateTo130(ts))
            .chain(ts => writeFile('tweets.json', ts))
          lib('@drboolean')
          .chain(f => saveToS3(f))
          .fork(e => console.error(e),
            r => console.log(r))
      Branching and Errors
        type: Either/Or
          just like fork
          if Left, calls first one
          if Right, calls right one
        ex: file read null checks
          /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-103.png
          const getConfig = () =>
            Either.try(fs.readFileSync)('cfg.json')
          const contrivedEx3 = () =>
            getConfig()
            .map(JSON.parse)
            .fold(e => 3000, c => c.port)
        ex: null checks
          /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-104.png
          const contrivedEx4 = user =>
            fromNullable(user.address) 
            .chain(a => fromNullable(a.match(/../)))
            .chain(zip => fromNullable(cityByZip(zip)))
            .fold(() => "can't find city", city => city)

        no loops in fp
          because loops mutate and side effects
          they are too low level

    monads = continuations of functions
      f: one input, two outputs
      how to compose them?
      use monad as an adapter: one input --> two inputs
      bind is the answer
        adaptive block
        one input --> two inputs
      bind
        let bind nextFunction optionInput =
          match optionInput with 
          | Some s -> nextFunction s
          | None -> None
      pyramid of dooms
        # null handling:
          let example input = 
            doSomething input
            |> bind doSomethingElse
            |> bind doAThirdThing
        # task finishing: async callbacks
          let taskBind f task =
            task.WhenFinished (fun taskResult -> f taskResult)
          let taskExample input = 
            startTask input 
            |> taskBind startAnotherTask
            |> taskBind startThirdTask
        # error handling for custom validation
    monoid
      rules
        closure
        associativity
        identity element
      ex
        1 + (2 + 3)
        "" + "alo"
      why useful?
        closure
          converts pairwise operations into reduce
            1 + 2 + 3
            [1, 2, 3] |> List.reduce (+)
        associativity
          i can use: divide and conquer, parallelization, incremental accumulation
          ex: incremental accumulation
            1 + 2 + 3
            (1 + 2 + 3) + 4
      is function composition a monoid?
        /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-91.png
        if input/output types are same types
        how to call them?
          endomorphisms
        ex: event sourcing
          event application function:
            Event -> State -> State
                     |\endomorphism/|
            any function containing an endomorphism can be converted into a monoid
            how?
              by partial application of events
              /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-92.png
    monads vs. monoids
      monads are actually monoids
    monad laws:
      monoid laws in disguise: closure, associativity, identity

    bind operator: >>=
      (>>=):: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
      m a olarak gelen girdinin m kutusunu çıkartır
      a üzerinde işlem yapıp m b'yi üretir.

  An Algebraic Approach to Functional Domain Modeling by Debasish Ghosh @ Functional Conf 16-0q-w16pOuyc.mp4
    Functional Domain Modeling  
      Domain Model definition:
        related to problem domain
        how the architect in the problem domain interact 
        we are solution architect

      Marius Eriksen: Your Server as a Function
        all twitter servers are structured based on fp
          composed algebraically
        twitter services are functions
      Domain model is a collecton of functions
    Domain Algebra
      domain entities -> algebraic data types
      domain behaviors -> functions [Type] -> Type
      business laws -> invariants (type system or properties)
      monoid + monad 
    Domain Modeling
      Domain Model = ∪_i domain_algebra_i
      domain_algebra = { m[T1,T2,...] | T(i) ∈ Types }
      module m = {f(x) | p(x) ∈ domain_rules }
    ex:
      use case
        1. client places order - flexible format
        2. transform to internal domain model entity and place for execution 
        3. trade and allocate to client accounts
      functions
        def clientOrders: ClientOrderSheet => List[Order]
          input in flexible format
        def execute: Market => Account => Order => List[Execution]
          market: where the trade will be executed
        def allocate: List[Account] => Execution => List[Trade]
      constraints:
        def clientOrders: ClientOrderSheet => List[Order]
        def execute[Account <: BrokerAccount]: Market => Account => Order => List[Execution]
          constrain the type of Account to be of BrokerAccount
            nothing except BrokerAccount can be passed
        def allocate[Account <: TradingAccount]: List[Account] => Execution => List[Trade]
      api
        we haven't yet implemented any type
        we don't know what an Account, Order is
        we have 
          types (domain entities)
          functions
          laws
        this is algebra of the api
        these 3 functions when joined together will give me a trade generation function
      put them into a module
        trait Trading[Account, Trade, ClientOrderSheet, Order, Execution, Market] {
          # parameterized on types
          def clientOrders: ClientOrderSheet => List[Order]
          def execute: Market => Account => Order => List[Execution]
          def allocate: List[Account] => Execution => List[Trade]
          def tradeGeneration(market: Market, broker: Account, clientAccounts: List[Account]) = ???
        # declarations (algebra) of the functions are there only
      algebraic design
        this is algebraic design
        algebra (interface) is the binding contract of the api
        implementation is not part of the algebra
          there can be multiple implementations
      let's do some algebra
        def clientOrders: ClientOrderSheet => List[Order]
        def execute( m: Market, broker: Account): Order => List[Execution]
        def allocate( accounts: List[Account]): Execution => List[Trade]
          output of clientOrders -> input of execute
          output of execute -> input of allocate

        def g: B => List[C]
        def h: C => List[D]
        # how to solve it
          they contain effects of aggregation and optionality
          they can be generalized
            def f[M: Monad]: A => M[B]
            def g[M: Monad]: B => M[C]

              }
          algebra of Kleisli:
            def clientOrders: Kleisli[ List, ClientOrderSheet, Order]
            def execute( m: Market, broker: Account): Kleisli[ List, Order, Execution]
            def allocate( accounts: List[Account]): Kleisli[ List, Execution, Trade]
      the complete trade generation logic
        def tradeGeneration(
          market: Market,
          broker: Account,
          clientAccounts: List[Account]) = {
          clientOrders andThen
            execute(market, broker) andThen
              allocate(clientAccounts)
          }
        # implementation follows the specification
        # we get ubiquitous language for free
        # no error handling here: they are encapsulated into Kleisli
    custom handling of errors
      how to do it?
      we need to report some to the user
      error handling as an effect
      stacking of effects
        def clientOrders: Kleisli[ List, ClientOrderSheet, Order]
        ->
        List --> M[List[_]]
      monad transformers
        ex:
          type Response[A] = String \/ Option[A]
          --->
          type Error[A] = String \/ A
          type Response[A] = OptionT[Error, A]
          # OptionT is a monad transformer
        List Transformer: ListT
        we want to get a list of orders
          type StringOr[A] = String \/ A
          type Valid[A] = ListT[SringOr, A]
          api
            def clientOrders: Kleisli[ List, ClientOrderSheet, Order]
            -->
            def clientOrders: Kleisli[ Valid, ClientOrderSheet, Order]
          a small change in algebra, a huge step for domain model
          domain model can now handle errors and report them
    Algebra of Types
      Kleisli: dependency injection

  Why Functional Programming Matters by John Hughes at Functional Conf 2016-XrNdvWqxBvA.mp4
    1940s
      fp was minimalist
        ex: who needs booleans
          booleans just makes a choice
          make functions to make choices
            true x y = x
            false x y = y
          define if then else
            ifte bool t e =
              bool t e
        ex: who needs integers
          integer just counts loop iterations
            two f x = f (f x)
            one f x = f x
          to recover a normal integer 
            two (+1) 0
          addition by sequecning loops
            add m n f x = m f (n f x)
          multiplication by nesting loops
            mul m n f x = m (n f) x
        ex: factorial

  Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures
    http://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html
    any value can be in a context
      context ≅ box
      you put value into a box
        Just 2
        value and context
      when you apply a function to this value
        different results depending on the context
      ex: Functors, Monads, Arrows 
      Maybe data type:
        two related contexts
        Just, Nothing
        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
    Functors
      when a value is in a context
        you can't apply a normal function to it:
          (+3) (Maybe 2)
          doesn't work
        you need fmap
        fmap knows how to apply functions to values in a context
          fmap (+3) (Just 2)
          > Just 5
      what is a Functor really?
        Functor is a typeclass
          to make a data type f a functor
            data type needs to define fmap
        code
          class Functor f where
            fmap:: (a->b) -> fa -> fb
        fmap
          takes a function: (a->b) = (+3)
          takes a functor: fa = Just 2
          returns a new functor: fb = Just 5
        note: Maybe is a Functor
          it specifies how fmap applies to Just and Nothing
        code
          instance Functor Maybe where
            fmap func (Just val) = Just (func val)
            fmap func Nothing = Nothing
      analogy: unbox and apply function and box again
      ex:
        fmap (+3) Nothing
        > Nothing
      why useful?
        if there is no Maybe and fmap
        then handling a database record:
          post = Post.find_by_id(1)
          if post
            return post.title
          else
            return nil
          end
        haskell:
          fmap (getPostTitle) (findPost 1)
        or using <$> infix version of fmap:
          getPostTitle <$> (findPost 1)
      ex: apply a function to a list
        fmap (+3) alist
      Lists are functors too:
        instance Functor [] where
          fmap = map
      ex: apply a function to another function
        fmap (+3) (+1)
        # result is composed function
        ex
          import Control.Applicative
          let foo = fmap (+3) (+2)
          foo 10
          > 15
      Functions are functors too:
        instance Functor ((->) r) where
          fmap f g = f . g
    Applicatives
      next step after Functor
        wraps values in a context
        wraps functions in a context too
      ex
        2 --> Just 2
        (+3) --> Just (+3)
      infix op: <*>
      Just (+3) <*> Just 2 == Just 5
      ex: interesting situations
        /Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-87.png
        [(*2), (+3)] <*> [1,2,3]
        > [2,4,6,4,5,6]
      ex: apply a function that takes two args
        functors can't
          (+) <$> (Just 5)
          > Just (+5)
          Just (+5) <$> (Just 4)
          > error
        applicatives can
          (+) <*> (Just 5)
          > Just (+5)
          Just (+5) <*> (Just 4)
          > Just 8
      ex:
        (*) <$> Just 5 <*> Just 3
        > Just 15
      liftA2 does the same thing:
        liftA2 (*) (Just 5) (Just 3)
        > Just 15
    Monads
      comparison:
        functors apply a function to a boxed value
        applicatives apply a boxed function to a boxed value
        monads apply a function that returns a boxed value to a boxed value
          using >>= bind function
      ex: Maybe is a monad
        suppose half is a function that works on even numbers:
          half x = if even x
            then Just (x `div` 2)
            else Nothing
        so half returns a Maybe (boxed value)
        what if we input a boxed value
          we need to use >>= 
          to shove boxed value into a function
        code
          Just 3 >>= half
          Nothing
          Just 4 >>= half
          Just 2
          Nothing >>= half
          Nothing
      Monad is a typeclass:
        class Monad m where
          (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
        where >>= is
          takes a monad: ma = Just 4
          takes a function that returns a monad: (a -> m b) = half
          returns a monad: m b = Just 2
      so Maybe is a Monad:
        instance Monad Maybe where
          Nothing >>= func = Nothing
          Just val >>= func = func val
      @mine: railway oriented programming
        f: takes one input, returns two outputs
        we need an adapter to make f take two inputs
        monad bind is the adapter
          input value: boxed (two inputs)
          returns: boxed (two outputs)
      ex: IO monad
        getLine: takes no arg and gets user input
        getLine :: IO String
        readFile: takes a filename and returns file's contents
        readFile :: FilePath -> IO String
        putStrLn: takes a string and prints it
        putStrLn :: String -> IO ()
        all three take a regular value and return a boxed value
        getLine >>= readFile >>= putStrLn
      do notation: syntactic sugar for monads
        foo = do
          filename <- getLine
          contents <- readFile filename
          putStrLn contents
    conclusion
      functor is a data type. implements Functor
      applicative is a data type. implements Applicative
      monad is a data type. implements Monad
      Maybe implements all three
      differences:
        functors: apply a function to boxed value using fmap or <$>
        applicatives: apply a function to boxed value using <*> or liftA
        monads: apply a function that returns a boxed value to a boxed value using >>= or liftM

  How I learned Haskell
    Benjamin C. Pierce’s Types and Programming Languages. 
      It was the best computer science text book I’ve ever read
    Philip Wadler’s Monads for functional programming 
      clicked my mind and I finally became enlightened.
    Once I understood how I could learn abstractions, the rest was easy
    papers to read
      FunctionaPearl
      A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold
      Monadic Parsing in Haskell
      Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters
      Data types a la carte
      The Essence of the Iterator Pattern
      The Zipper
    Haskell I know was different from the Haskell that is actually used. Real world Haskell uses lots of GHC extensions which makes me feel it is an entirely different language
    I founded a small Haskell shop this year and started to use Haskell in production. I realized that using Haskell in production was, surprisingly, easier than learning Haskell.

    Why type systems matter for UX: an example

      ex: deleting comments in Word
        takes a lot of time to discover how to do
      lots of books to teach how to use those big apps
      i need complex functionality
        but they need be easy to discover
      type systems solve exactly this problem
      ex: Word with type system
        click on a comment
        ask for functions: accepting a List Comment
        choose "delete comments"
    If Haskell is so great, why hasn't it taken over the world? And the curious case of Go.

  Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and "this"
    http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/11/understanding-javascript-function-invocation-and-this/
    The Core Primitive
      Function's call method
        core function invocation primitive
      1. Make an argument list (argList) out of parameters 1 through the end
      2. The first parameter is thisValue
      3. Invoke the function with this set to thisValue and the argList as its argument list
      ex
        function hello(thing) {  
          console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
        }
        hello.call("Yehuda", "world") //=> Yehuda says hello world  
      all other calls are desugaring to this primitive
        desugar: take a syntax and describe it in terms of more basic core primitve
    Simple Function Invocation
      a function invocation like fn(...args) is the same as fn.call(window [ES5-strict: undefined], ...args)
      ex
        hello("world")
        // desugars to:
        hello.call(undefined, "world");  
    Member Functions
      ex: invoke a method as a member of an object
        var person = {  
        name: "Brendan Eich",
        hello: function(thing) {
          console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
          }
        }
        person.hello("world")
        // desugars to this:
        person.hello.call(person, "world"); 
      ex: attaching object dynamically
        function hello(thing) {  
          console.log(this + " says hello " + thing);
          }
        person = { name: "Brendan Eich" }  
        person.hello = hello;
        person.hello("world") // still desugars to person.hello.call(person, "world")
    Using Function.prototype.bind
      ex
        var person = {  
        name: "Brendan Eich",
        hello: function(thing) {
          console.log(this.name + " says hello " + thing);
          }
        }
        var boundHello = function(thing) { return person.hello.call(person, thing); }
        boundHello("world");  
        # boundHello call still desugars to boundHello.call(window, "world"), we turn right around and use our primitive call method to change the this value back to what we want it to be.
  Understanding "Prototypes" in JavaScript
    http://yehudakatz.com/2011/08/12/understanding-prototypes-in-javascript/
    A Whole New Object
      to create simplest new object:
        var person = Object.create(null)
        // empty object
      why not: var person = {}
      person['name'] // undefined
      if the String is valid identifier, you can use dot form:
        person.name // undefined
      identifier: starts with unicode letter, $, _
        valid identifier: not a reserved word
    Adding values
      what a property is?
        it has a name  and value
        it can be enumerable, configurable, writable
        if enumarable: for (prop in obj)
        if writable: you can replace it
        if configurable: you can delete/change its other attributes
      ex: verbose
        Object.defineProperty(person, 'firstName', {  
          value: "Yehuda",
          writable: true,
          enumerable: true,
          configurable: true
        });
      ex: defineProperty method
        var config = {  
          writable: true,
          enumerable: true,
          configurable: true
        };
        var defineProperty = function(obj, name, value) {  
          config.value = value;
          Object.defineProperty(obj, name, config);
        }
        var person = Object.create(null);  
        defineProperty(person, 'firstName', "Yehuda");  
    Prototypes
      so far: 
        objects as simple pairs of keys and values
        js objects have one additional attribute:
          a pointer to another object
          this pointer: object's prototype
      Object.getPrototypeOf
      Object.create(man) // man is prototype
    Setting Properties
      defining properties using assignment syntax
      ex
        var man = Object.create(person);  
        man['sex'] = "male";
        man.sex
    Object Literals
      ex
        var person = { firstName: "Paul", lastName: "Irish" }  
        // This syntax is approximately sugar for:
        var person = Object.create(Object.prototype);  
        person.firstName = "Paul";  
        person.lastName  = "Irish";  
      Object.prototype has default properties

  What is side effect
    http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/40297/what-is-a-side-effect
      modification of some kind of state
      ex
        changing value of a variable
        writing data to disk
        enabling/disabling a UI button
      contrary to what people say
        it does not need to be hidden
        nothing to do with idempotency
      side effect = changing something somewhere
      pure function
        a) idempotent
        b) has no side effects
    http://wiki.c2.com/?SideEffect
      when a function causes
        a non-local change to something
        other than its inputs and declared output
    https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/05/18/pure-functions-have-side-effects/
      pure functions are pure at certain level of abstraction
        every function has some side effect
          it uses memory, cpu 
      you can partition stateful and stateless parts
        85% functional purity is possible
  @mine: comparison Functor - Applicative - Monad
    Functor
      map
      value is boxed
      function is normal
      unbox it -> apply f -> box it
      fmap :: (a->b) -> f a -> f b
    Applicative
      lift
      both value and function is boxed
      function returns normal
      lift :: f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
    Monad
      bind
      value is boxed
      function is normal but returns boxed
      bind :: (a -> f b) -> f a -> f b
  @mine: why do we say: monads are to compose side effects?
    because input functions of functors are normal
    input functions of monads are boxed

      how to keep track of the state in such a situation?
        Move returns a pair
          new state
          actual distance moved
      transforming function
        in:
          TurtleState
          input (angle, distance ...)
        out:
          new TurtleState
          output (output of the function)
        currying
          input -> TurtleState -> (TurtleState, output)
        input --> Turtle function --> State<>
        State<> function wraps State
      usage: state expression
        inside the block state is threaded

  Monad - FunFunFunction #21-9QveBbn7t_c.mp4
    streams are functors
      so we can map() them
    monads are more powerful functors
      that can also flatMap()
    Promises are monad?
      do they have flatMap()
        yes, it is then()
      ex:
        const promise = fetch(url)
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(parsedResponse => ...)
      take response.json()
        this doesn't return object literal
        it returns a Promise
        which is then flattened to its value
        then it is passed to the next then()
    ex
      getInPortugese :: String -> Stream
      # note Stream is a monad
      stream
        .flatMap(word => getInPortugese(word))
        .map(word => word.toUpperCase())
        .onValue(word => console.log(word))
      # flatMap's inner function returns a Stream
      # but flatMap flattens it and returns the contained value: String
      # so we can use map() after flatMap()
  Free Monads
    What are free monads
      http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13352205/what-are-free-monads
        Free monads: turning functors into monads
        given functor f
        Free f: is a monad
        you get functions:
          liftFree :: Functor f => f a -> Free f a
          foldFree :: Functor f => (f r -> r) -> Free f r -> r
        liftFree: lets you get into monad
        foldFree: lets you get out of it
        ex: 
          a monoid X
          is a set Y
          with extra structure P
            that says it has an operation (addition) and identity (zero)
          generally:
            if X is a Y with P
            then a free X is a way of
              getting from Y to X
          ex:
            code
              class Monoid m where
                mempty :: m
                mappend :: m -> m -> m
            lists:
              data [a] = [] | a : [a]
            given t, [t] is a monoid
              instance Monoid [t] where
                mempty = []
                mappend = (++)
            so lists are free monoid over sets

    fp
      essentially:
        small reusable functions
        call them one after the other:
          f1.f2.f3
          f1(f2(f3))
      to write in this style
        functions need to follow some rules
    fp challenges
      1. how to handle if-else condition (Either Monad)
      2. Null exceptions (Maybe Monad)
      3. functions are truly reusable, and can be reused anywhere (pure functions, referential transparency)
      4. data is unchanged so that we can reuse data elsewhere (pure functions, immutability)
      5. function taking multiple values, chaining only passes a single value, still make it part of chain (currying, higher order functions)
      6. more

      Functors
        a class that stores a value and implements map method
        ex: Array
          stores a value
          implements map
        ex: MyFunctor
          const add1 = (a) => a + 1;
          class MyFunctor { //Custom "Functor"
            constructor(value) {
              this.val = value;
            }
            map(fn) {   //Applies function to this.val + returns new Myfunctor
             return new Myfunctor(fn(this.val));
            }
          }
          //temp is a Functor instance that's storing value 1
          let temp = new MyFunctor(1); 
          temp.map(add1) //-> temp allows us to map "add1"
      Monads
        Functors + ap from Apply + ap and of from Applicative + chain from Chain
        code
          class Monad {
              constructor(val) {
                  this.__value = val;
              }
              static of(val) {//Monad.of is simpler than "new Monad(val)
                  return new Monad(val);
              };
              map(f) {//Applies the function but returns another Monad!
                  return Monad.of(f(this.__value));
              };
              join() { // used to get the value out of the Monad
                  return this.__value;
              };
              chain(f) {//Helper func that maps and then gets the value out
                  return this.map(f).join();
              };
               ap(someOtherMonad) {//Used to deal w/ multiple Monads
                  return someOtherMonad.map(this.__value);
              }
          }
        specific monads: Maybe, Either
      Maybe Monad
        takes care of null
        if stored value is null, then map doesn't run the function
        it creates an instance of two sub-classes: Just or Nothing

    Reductio and Abstract 'em
      http://www.tomharding.me/2017/02/24/reductio-and-abstract-em/
      you can write every list function with reduceRight
        two caveats
          we have two functions for free:
            const head = ([x, ... xs]) => x
            const cons = (x, xs) => [x, ... xs]
          cons: prepend
        map
          its accumulator is another list
            const map = (f, xs) => xs.reduceRight(
              (acc, x) => cons(f(x), acc), 
              []
            )
            map(x => x +1)([1,2,3])
        filter
          const filter = (p,xs) => xs.reduceRight(
            (acc, x) => p(x) ? cons(x,acc)
              : acc,
            []
          )
          filter(x => x<3)([1,2,3,4])
        append
          const append = (x,xs) => xs.reduceRight(
            (acc,h) => cons(h, acc), [x]
          )
          append(4)([1,2,3])
          # reduceRight does nothing
          # it starts with a non-empty accumulator
        concat
          const concat = (xs, ys) =>
            xs.reduceRight(
              (acc, h) => cons(h, acc), ys
            )
          concat([1,2])([3,4])
        reverse
          const reverse = xs => xs.reduceRight(
            (acc, x) => append(x, acc), []
          )
        length
          const length = xs => xs.reduceRight(
            (n, _) => n + 1, 0
          )
        elemAt
          const elemAt = (n, xs) => head(xs.reduce(
            ([e,n], x) => [n == 0 ? x : e, n-1],
            [undefined, n]
          ))
        reduce
          const reduce = (f, acc, xs) =>
            xs.reduceRight(
              (accF, x) => z => accF(f(z, x)),
              x => x
            )(acc)
      A Strangely Familiar List
        a list cen be expressed as
          [] empty or
          [x, ... xs] a non-empty list
            an item followed by another list
            = linked list
        why we got cons and head?
          they do: construct and destruct
          they are ways to describe the structure of list
      Int-reduce-ing Our Hero
        how reduceRight works:
          [].reduceRight(f, acc) = acc
          [x, ... xs].reduceRight(f, acc) =
            f(xs.reduceRight(f, acc), x)
        why map and filter is less general?
          reduceRight has
            empty and non-empty behavior
            accumulator
          thus free to change shape of the list entirely
        what reduceRight does: catamorphism
          a way of folding a type (list)
          into a value
        if you have access to all possible configurations of your structure
          you can do anything you like
      reduce vs reduceRight
      can reduceRight do anything with lists?
        yes
        catamorphism are called folds
          which implies an unfold
            anamorphism
            ex: function that produces a range
              unfolding a starting number into a list
  Fantas, Eel, and Specification 1: Daggy
    http://www.tomharding.me/2017/03/03/fantas-eel-and-specification/
    daggy: for creating sum types
    two functions: tagged, taggedSum
    tagged
      for creating types with one constructor
      ex
        // Coord :: (Int, Int) -> Coord
        const Coord = daggy.tagged('x', 'y', 'z')
        // Line :: (Coord, Coord) -> Line
        const Line = daggy.tagged('from', 'to')
      resulting structures:
        Coord.prototype.translate = 
          function (x,y,z) {
            return Coord(
              this.x + x,
              this.y + y,
              this.z + z
            )
          }
          const origin = Coord(0,0,0)
          const myLine = Line( origin, origin.translate(2,4,6) )
    taggedSum(constructors)
      think: boolean type
        has two values
        in order to represent Bool
          we need a type with multiple constructors (sum type)
        code
          const Bool = daggy.taggedSum({
            True: [], False: []
          })
      ex: Coord
        const Shape = daggy.taggedSum({
          // Square :: (Coord, Coord) -> Shape
          Square: ['topleft', 'bottomright'],
          // Circle :: (Coord, Number) -> Shape
          Circle: ['centre', 'radius']
        })
      Square, Circle are constructors of Shape type
        Shape.prototype.translate =
          function (x,y,z) {
            return this.cata({
              Square: (topleft, bottomright) =>
                Shape.Square(
                  topleft.translate(x,y,z),
                  bottomright.translate(..)
              Circle: ..
        Square(Coord(2,2,0), Coord(3,3,0))
          .translate(3,3,3)
      note: Shape isn't constructor, it is type. 
        we attach methods to Shape prototype
        Shape.Square and Shape.Circle are constructors
      thus: to write a method
        it should work in all forms of Shape type
      this.cata: killer feature of Daggy
        catamorphism
        we pass a {constructor: handler} object to cata function
      we can attach methods to Bool:
        const { True, False } = Bool
        Bool.prototype.invert = function() {
          return this.cata({
            False: () => True,
            True: () => False
          })
        }
        // shorthand for Bool.prototype.cata
        Bool.prototype.thenElse = function (then, or) {
          return this.cata({ True: then, False: or})
        }
      note: different constructors can have different numbers and types of arguments
      taggedSum: lets us build types with multiple constructors
      List but not least

      -->
      functional way:
        return a description of what we want to do
          we return a little program for some kind of interpreter
    coproduct
      def transfer(..) List[Instruction]
      where instruction is the coproduct of:
        log 
        fail with error
        authorize user
        read/write storage
      @mine 
        note: lists are like tuples
        coproducts are tuples
        we build tuple of (Log,Fail,Authorize,...)
        then we fold this tuple
        which means we do catamorphism (folding)
        this is pure function, because we return a tuple
          which is a recipe for program
          actual program is evaluated during run time
    ex of such an instruction: for user interaction
      def
        sealed trait Interact[A]
        case class Ask(prompt: String) extends Interact[String]
        case class Tell(msg: String) extends Interact[Unit]
      use: our program a list of interactions
        val prg = 
          List(
            Ask("your name?"),
            Ask("your last name?"),
            Tell("Tell, "),
        --> monads: allow assign things
          # it is a list comprehension
        val prg = for{ 
          x <- Ask("your name?"),
          y <- Ask("your last name?"),
          _ <- Tell("Tell, $x $y"),
        } yield ()
      Monad def
        trait Monad[M[_]] {
          def pure[A](a: A): M[A]
            # Box.of
          def flatMap[A,B](ma: M[A])(f: A => M[B]): M[B]
        }
        # also named: return, bind
      how to implement pure, flatMap for Interact?
        using Free Monads
        program:
          val prg: Free[Interact, Unit] = for{ 
            x <- Ask("your name?"),
            y <- Ask("your last name?"),
            _ <- Tell("Tell, $x $y"),
          } yield ()
        this is syntactic sugar for flatMap:
          val prg: Free[Interact, Unit] = for{ 
            Ask("your name?").flatMap(first =>
            Ask("your last name?").flatMap(last =>
            Tell("Tell, $first $last").map(_ =>())))
          } yield ()
      what does it mean to run a free monad?
        running a free monoid (which is list)
          = running a list
          = folding a list
            @mine:
              (bind(bind(bind ...)
        how do you fold a free monad?
          signature of foldMap
          foldmap[G[_]:Monad](f: F ~> G): G[A]
            i have a transformation from F to G
            i can convert all program into G
            i have list of instructions
              translate them to G language
            then we compose using monadic binds
            as if:
              F: compile time language
              G: run time language
            ~>: we can transform F to G

    Algebraic data types
      goal
        translate data descriptions into code
        particularly: model data with logical ors and logical ands
      structure of code follows
        structure of data
      ex:
        a website visitor is
          logged in or
          anonymous
        a logged in user has
          an ID and
          an email address
      @mine
        inheritance / is-a relationship
          corresponds to logical or
        composition / has relationship
          corresponds to logical and
      product types: and
        final case class A(b: B, c:C)
        # A has a B and C
      sum types: or
        sealed trait A
        final case class B() extends A
        final case class C() extends A
        # A is a B or C
      sum and product together
        make algebraic data types
      ex
        sealed trait Visitor {
          id: Id
        }
        final case class Anonymous(id: Id)
          extends Visitor
        final case class User(id: Id, email: Email)
          extends Visitor
      ex
        # a calculation is a success or failure
        sealed trait Calculation
        final case class Success() extends Calculation
        final case class Failure() extends Calculation
      ex
        # a success has an value
        # a failure has an error message
        final case class Success(value: Int) extends Calculation
        final case class Failure(msg: String) extends Calculation
      summary
        code follows from structure of the data
    Structural Recursion
      goal
        transform algebraic data types
      ex
        implement on calculation
        def add(value: Int) : Calculation =???
      two patterns:
        pattern matching
        = polymorphism
      ex
        sealed trait A {
          def doSomething: H = {
            this match {
              case B(d, e) => doB(d, e)
              case C(f, g) => doC(f, g)
            }
          }
        }
        final case class B(d: D, e: E) extends A
        final case class C(f: F, g: G) extends A
      ex: add an Int to a Calculation
        sealed trait Calculation {
          def add(value: Int): Calculation = 
            this match {
              case Success(v) => Success(v + value)
              case Failure(msg) => Failure(msg)
    Sequencing Computation
      what is sequencing
        fp is about transforming values
        A => B => C
          function composition
      three patterns
        fold, map, flatMap
      fold
        A => B
        it works on algebraic data types
        abstraction over structural recursion
      ex
        sealed trait A {
          def doSomething: H = {
            this match {
              case B(d, e) => doB(d, e)
              case C(f, g) => doC(f, g)

      fold is a generic transform
        for any algebraic data type
      fold is not always the best choice
        two reasons
          not all data is an algebraic data type
            ex: Future, infinite lists
      ex:
        getting a user from database
          Result[User]
        convert that user to json
          User => Json
          Result[Json]

  A Million Ways to Fold in JS-JZSoPZUoR58.mp4
    alternative ways to loop
    there is no loops in fp
      because it has 
        low level operations
        side effects
    recursion
      var sum = xs =>
        if (xs.length === 0) return 0
        return first(xs) + sum(rest(xs))
      var reverse = xs =>
        if (xs.length === 0) return []
        return reverse(rest(xs).concat(first(xs))
      commonalities
        base case: 0 []
        recursion: sum(..) reverse(..)
        action: + concat
      how evald
        sum([1,2,3])
          1 + sum([2,3])
          1+(2+sum([3])
          1+(2+(3+sum([])))
          1+(2+(3+0))
        es6
          tail recursive optimization
      tail recursive
        var sum = xs =>
          if (xs.length === 0) return 0
          return first(xs) + sum(rest(xs))
        -->
        var sum = xs =>
          function go(acc, xs) {
            if (xs.length === 0) return acc
            return go(acc+first(xs), rest(xs))
          }
          return go(0, list)
        # nothing left in return call except nested call
      var reduce = function(f, acc, xs) {
        if(xs.length ===0) return acc
        return reduce(f, f(acc, first(xs)), rest(xs))
      }
      reduce is tail recursive
        so we can implement sum, reverse in terms of reduce
      var sum = xs =>
        reduce((acc, x) => x + acc, 0, xs)
      var reverse = xs =>
        reduce((acc, x) => [x].concat(acc), [], xs)
      reduce is very general
        can implement all list functions
        it is a catamorphism
        any loop can be captured with a fold
        apomorphism
        paramorphism
        higher order loops
    corecursion
      called anamorphism
      unfold:
        var unfold = (f, seed) =>
          function go(f, seed, acc) {
            var res = f(seed)
            return res ? go(f, res[1], acc.concat([res[0]])) : acc
          } 
          return go(f, seed, [])
      unfold(x => if(x < 26) [String.fromCharCode(x+65), x + 1], 0)
        equivalent to while loop
      var range = (i, count) =>
        unfold(..)
      var tree = ..
    transducers
      v1
        var map = (f, xs) =>
          reduce((acc, x) => concat(acc, f(x)), [], xs)
      transformation: f(x)
      accumulation: concat, []
      iteration: xs
      reducer: (acc, x) => concat(acc, f(x))
        also named: reducing fct
      v2 
        var mapper = (f,cnct) =>
          (acc, x) => cnct(acc, f(x))
        reduce( mapper(x => x + 1, concat), [], [1,2,3])
        // [2,3,4]
      make filter
        var filterer = (f,cnct) =>
          (acc, x) => f(x) ? cnct(acc, x) : acc
        reduce( filterer(x => x > 1, concat), [], [1,2,3] )
        // [2,3]
      look at signature: 
        (acc, x) 
        cnct(acc, x)
        cnct function has same args and does the same thing as reducer function
          it takes a acc and elem, and returns an acc
        our concat is a reducing function as well
      make copy with concat as reducer
        var copy = xs =>
          reduce(concat, [], xs)
      we can pass other reducing fcts to other reducing fcts
        filterer(x => x > 1, mapper(x => x + 1, concat))
        // (acc, x) => x > 1 ? concat(acc, f(x)) : acc
      this is function composition
      we can make pipeline of transformations
        mapper, filter is called: transducer
        note: reduction is itself in one loop
          not first map, then filter loop
      ex
        reduce( 
          filterer(x => x > 1,
          mapper(x => x + 1, concat)),
          [], [1,2,3])
        // [3,4]
      this does stream fusion
      protocols
        iteration +
        transformation +
        accumulation x
          there is no protocol here
    monoids
      there is a protocol for accumulation 
        it is monoid
      ex: concat has properties
        // left identity
        concat( [], xs ) == xs
        // right identity
        concat( xs, [] ) == xs
        // associativity
        concat(concat(xs, ys), zs) == concat(xs, concat(ys, zs))
      fantasy-land has specification for this
        anything is a monoid if it has
          concat
          identity element
          associativity
      let's make monoids
        list is a monoid
        sum
          constructor
            var _Sum = function(x) { this.val = x }
            var Sum = function(x) { return new _Sum(x) }
          reduce's first two args: reducer, empty
            _Sum.prototype.concat = function(y) { 
              return Sum(this.val + y.val)
            }
            _Sum.prototype.empty = function() { return Sum(0) }
          now we can call reduce/fold with list data
            fold([Sum(1), Sum(2)])
            // Sum(3)
        product
          fold([Product(3), Product(4)])
        max
          fold([Max[12], Max[3])
        all
          fold([All(false), All(true)])
      make foldMap: fold down, and give me the value
        var foldMap = (f,xs) => compose(fold, map(f))(xs)
        var sum = xs => foldMap(Sum, xs).val
        var max = xs => foldMap(Max, xs).val
        var any = xs => foldMap(Any, xs).val
      it can work on any structure
        var tree = Node(Node(Leaf(2), 1, Leaf(3)))
        sum(tree)
        product(tree)
      because of associativity, it can run in parallel
      fold reduces list into one value
        F(a) -> a
        [Sum(a)] -> Sum(a)
        [Product(a)] -> Product(a)
      that is called an algebra
    F-algebra
      code: cata
        var cata = (f, xs) =>
          f( xs.map( ys => cata(f, ys) ) )
      fixed point of a functor
        a functor: anything with map method
        fixed point: returns itself
      ex
        Nil.map = f => Nil
        _Cons.prototype.map = function(f) {
          return Cons(this.head, f(this.tail))

## Brian Lonsdorf

### Brian Lonsdorf - Oh Composable World!-SfWR3dKnFIo.mp4

``` js
const ProfileLink = user =>
  <a href={`/users/${u.id}`}>{u.name}</a>

const ProfileLink = user =>
  a({href: `/users/${user.id}`}, user.name)

const Comp = g =>
({
  fold: g,
  contramap: f =>
    Comp(x => g(f(x)))
})

const Heading = str => h1(`Now Viewing ${str}`);
const Title = Comp(Heading).contramap(s => s.pageName);

Title.fold({ 
  pageName: 'Home',
  currentUser: { id: 2, name: 'Chris' }
});
// <h1>
``` 

`contramap` is the opposite of `map`

`contramap` prepends its input function `f` to the existing function `g` of
`Comp`.

How to do this with usual `map`?

``` js
const s = { pageName: 'Home', currentUser: { id: 2, name: 'Chris' } }
const f = s => s.pageName
const g = Heading

Box(s)
  .map(g)
  .fold(f)

Comp(f)
  .contramap(g)
  .fold(s)
``` 

`concat` function concatenates two components:

``` js
const Comp = g =>
({
  fold: g,
  contramap: f => Comp(x => g(f(x))),
  concat: other => 
    Comp(x => div( g(x) + other.fold(x) ))
})
``` 

``` js
const Link = Comp(ProfileLink).contramap(s => s.currentUser)
const App = Heading.concat(Link)
App.fold(s)
// <div>
//   <h1>Now viewing Home</h1>
//   <a href="/users/22">Chris</a>
// </div>
``` 

`Reducer`

``` js
