## File Permissions

    http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/permissions.php
      what are they?
        3 things you can do with a file:
          r read
          w write
          x execute
        3 sets of people:
          owner
          group: a file belongs to a single group
          others
      view permissions
        ls -l
          -rwxr----x ...
          1: file type
            "-" normal file
            d   directory
          2-4: permissions for owner
            -   absence of permission
            rwx: has all permissions
          5-6: permissions for group
          7-9: permissions for others
      change permissions
        chmod: change file mode bits
          bit: permission indicators
        chmod [permissions] [path]
        arguments: 3 components
          whose permission: 
            [ugoa]: user(owner), group, others, all
          grant/revoke permission 
            + or -
          which permission
            r or w or x
        ex
          $ ls -l frog.png
          -rwxr----x 1 harry users 2.7K Jan 4 07:32 frog.png
          $ chmod g+x frog.png
          $ ls -l frog.png
          -rwxr-x--x 1 harry users 2.7K Jan 4 07:32 frog.png
          $ chmod u-w frog.png
          $ ls -l frog.png
          -r-xr-x--x 1 harry users 2.7K Jan 4 07:32 frog.png
        ex: multiple permissions at once
          chmod g+wx frog.png
          chmod go-x frog.png
      permissions shorthand
        logic
          3 permissions
          each can be on or off
          8 possible combinations: 2^3
          map between octal and binary
            5 = 101
            means: 
              1: on read
              0: off write
              1: on execute
          751 means:
            7 for owner
            5 for group
            1 for others
      permissions for directories
        r read
        w write
        x enter (cd)
      root user
        2 users can change permissions
          root, owner

    Add a User to a Group (or Second Group) on Linux
      https://www.howtogeek.com/50787/add-a-user-to-a-group-or-second-group-on-linux/
      $ groups
        list groups 
      create a new group
        $ groupadd <name>
      add an existing user to a group
        $ usermod -a -G <group> <username>
        ex: add user geek to group sudo
          $ usermod -a -G sudo geek
      change a user's primary group
        a user can have multiple groups. 
          but one group is primary and others are secondary
        user creates files and folders
          they are assigned to primary group
        change primary group
          $ usermod -g <group> <user>
        assign secnodary group
          $ usermod -G <group> <user>
      view the groups of a user
        for current user
          $ groups
          uid=1000(chris) gid=1000(chris) groups=1000(chris),4(adm)...
          # gid=1000(chris) is primary group
        view numerical ids of each group
          $ id
        $ groups <user>
        $ id <user>
      create a user and assign a group
        $ useradd -G <group> <username>
        assign a password afterwards
          $ passwd <username>
      add a user to multiple groups
        $ usermod -a -G group1,group2 <username>
      view all groups on system
        $ getent group

      octal notation
        4: read
        2: write
        1: execute
        sum them up: 6 = 4 + 2
      umask: setting default permissions
        files have 666: full rw for all
        directories have: 777
        umask: applies subtractive mask
        ex: to make 775 default for directories
          umask 002
        ex: to make 666 and 777 default
          umask 000
        put umask into .bashrc to persist across sessions

    Howto: Linux Add User To Group
      https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-linux-add-user-to-group/
      2 types of groups:
        primary user group
        secondary user group
      user account information stored in:
        /etc/passwd
          one line per user
        /etc/shadow
          passwords encrypted
        /etc/group
          defines groups
        /etc/default/useradd
          value for default group
        /etc/login.defs
          configuration for shadow password
      useradd: add a new user to secondary group
        ex: create user "vivek" add it to group "developers"
          make sure group "developers" exist
            $ grep developers /etc/group
            developers:x:1124:
          add group "developers" if none exists
            $ groupadd developers
          make sure user "vivek" does not exist
            $ grep ^vivek /etc/passwd
          add user "vivek"
            $ useradd -G developers vivek
          setup password for "vivek"
            $ passwd vivek
          ensure "vivek" is added to group
            $ id vivek
            uid=1122(vivek) gid=1125(vivek) groups=1125(vivek),1124(developers)
      usermod: add an existing user to existing group
    primary group vs secondary group
      What is the difference between primary group and secondary group in Ubuntu?
        https://askubuntu.com/questions/538130/what-is-the-difference-between-primary-group-and-secondary-group-in-ubuntu
        ex: you have primary group "x" secondary "y"
          $ touch foo
            foo: x group owner
          $ sg y 'touch bar'
            bar: y group owner
        ex: you don't have secondary group
          $ sg y 'touch bar'
            asks for group password
        check secondary groups 
          groups $(whoami)
    Shared Folder with chmod SetGID
      http://terokarvinen.com/2011/shared-folder-with-chmod-setgid
      how to share a folder?
      how to get write permission to files other users have created?
      problem: don't make folders writable to others
        even daemons can write then
      solution: set group id
        code
          $ mkdir foo
          $ chmod g+s foo/ 
            set group id
          $ sudo chown .botbook foo
        we set SetGID aka set group id bit using chmod
        SetGID means: all files under foo/ will
          have same owner group "botbook"
          will have SetGID set
        check
          $ ls -l
          drwxrws--- 2 tero botbook 4096 2011-04-12 10:37 foo
        note: "s" in group permissions in place of "x"
          that is SetGID bit
        testing
          $ touch foo/bar
          $ ls -l foo/bar
          -rw-rw---- 1 tee botbook 0 2011-04-12 10:39 foo/bar
          note: group "botbook"

      https://askubuntu.com/questions/376199/sudo-su-vs-sudo-i-vs-sudo-bin-bash-when-does-it-matter-which-is-used
        su: switch user
          su -
            switch to root
        sudo: run a single command with root
          prompts password of current user
          user must be in sudoers file or group 
        bash: interface to interact with computer
          login shell: 
          non-login shell: graphic terminal in gnome
          interactive shell: interactively type commands
          non-interactive shell: to run automated process
        sudo su: calls sudo with command su
          bash is called as interactive non-login shell
            so bash executes .bashrc
          you are still in the same directory
        sudo su -: this time it is login shell
          so /etc/profile, .profile, .bashrc are executed
          you are in root's home
        sudo /bin/bash
      https://askubuntu.com/questions/70534/what-are-the-differences-between-su-sudo-s-sudo-i-sudo-su
        sudo su:
          first: sudo asks you for your password
          next: invokes "su" as a super-user
            since su is invoked by root, it doesn't require to enter target user's password
        sudo -s: runs a shell with root privileges
          in your directory
          ~/.bashrc is respected
        sudo -i: same but in root environment
          ~/.bashrc is ignored
          better than -s
      https://www.howtogeek.com/111479/htg-explains-whats-the-difference-between-sudo-su/

    login shell vs non-login shell
      https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/38175/difference-between-login-shell-and-non-login-shell
      login shell: first process that runs under your user id when you log in

          read() write() work like they do with files and pipes
      socket types
        4 types
        1. stream sockets
          use tcp
        2. datagram sockets
          not guaranteed in network
          don't have an open connection
          use udp
        3. raw sockets
          not for general user
        4. sequenced packet sockets
    network addresses
    network host names
      hostname resolution
        host name -> ip address
        done by DNS
        done by /etc/hosts
