    Unanimous AI CEO Dr. Louis Rosenberg on Human Swarming
      artificial swarm intelligence
        creating ai that keeps people in the loop
          instead of entirely machine based
    Crowds vs Swarms, a Comparison of Intelligence
      http://unanimous.ai/wp-content/uploads/Crowds-Vs-Swarms-SHBI2016-Final-PDF-confirmed-by-IEEE.pdf
      abstract
        collective intelligence: groups outperform individuals when making decisions, predictions
          crowd based methods
          this is not natural world
        natural world: closed-loop systems (swarms)
          converge on solutions in synchrony
        predictive ability of swarms better than crowds
      introduction
        francis galton 1906 england: weight of ox
          averaging all estimates: near perfect
        what other methods exist apart of averaging?
          nature: real time closed loop systems with feedback
        artificial swarm intelligence (asi) (human swarming):
          to explore decision space
          to converge upon preferred solutions
      tool
        magnets
        each user sees only its own magnet
          to limit social biasing
      natural swarms
        honey bees: preference for new hive
          real time negotiation
          optimal decision: 80% of time
          hundreds of scout bees pool their knowledge 
      human swarms
        magnet positioning
        results in real time physical negotiation
        first: users begin by pulling to option they prefer
        then: shift to alternate choices if the puck moves towards an option they dislike
      morality
        tragedy of commons
          individuals that act rationally on local scale, are prone to producing immoral results on group scale
      morality testing
        part 1
          0.90 $ or 0.30 $ bonus
          if less than 30% requests 0.90$, ok
          swarm: 24% pulled towards 0.90
        part 2
          3 teams
          each team asks for 0.75 or 0.25
          if 2 teams ask for 0.75, nobody gets anything
