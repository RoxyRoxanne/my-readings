		ampul hikayesi	
			https://youtu.be/5B5C-4FBz0c?t=50m40s
			haftalarca bir ampul özelliği geliştirdik video player için. ie6'da çalışmıyor, 7'de çalışıyor. dur ağbi, bitecek.
			sonunda hakikaten değdi. bir ay içinde 6 kez kullanılmış.
			acele acele demek istemiyorum da, çabuk çabuk. 
			mümkün olduğunca hızlı, bırakın, serbest bırakın. sonradan yaparsınız. aceleniz yok.
		çok fazla general, asker yok
			https://youtu.be/5B5C-4FBz0c?t=52m30s
			too many genarals, not enough infantry
			herkes patron, cepheye gidecek asker yok.
			şunun şurasına şöyle bir şey yapalım. burasına da böyle bir şey yapalım. tabi yapalım. yani yapılsın. keşke olsa. kim yapacak. yaparız. onu ben şeye yaptırırım.
			herkes yapalım. aklımıza süper bir fikir geliyor.

### Towards Design Theory and expandable rationality - Herbert Simon.pdf

	Armand Hatchuel
	intro
		Simon's self description
			i am a monomaniac in decision making
		explain complex behaviour by simple, constrained, informed decision rules
		emprically grounded theory of human problem solving
		foundation stone of behavioural economics
		problem solving
			key for
				science of design
					= science of artificial
						opposed to: natural sciecnes
		design theory unfinished
			2 reasons
				design: special form of problem solving
					correct:
						problem solving is restricted form of design
				social interaction: limited in design process
			expandable rationality
				potential paradigm for design theory
	from decision making to design theory
		50s: rational behaviour = optimization
			deterministic (simple)
			expected utility (sophisticated)
			OR, micro economics, statistics
		bounded rationality and decision paradigm
			bounded rationality
				refuses optimal choice
			satisficing principle
				introduces subjectivity, rules of thumb, heuristics, ad hoc moves
				satisfaction
					endogeneously defined within decision process
				how to research decision making
					games, puzzles: how we look for satisficing solutions
		creativity and design as problem solving
			distinction between sciences:
				natural sciences
					study how the world is 
					excludes normative
				sciences of the artificial = design sciences
					study how thing should be in order to attain goals
			his approach to design process
				"The processes of creative thinking"
					the product of thinking has novelty and value
					the problem was vague and ill defined
					part of the task was to formulate the problem itself
					imagery:
						a plan to problem solver
						as a list of elements he his dealing
					imagination
						necessary for creative process
						role: offer a list of options
							to progressively explore
							until satisficing solution appears
	an approach to design theory: limits of a problem solving perspective
		complexity comes from
			combinatorial explosion of solutions
		satisficing solutions
			dependent on previous experience
		what are differences between problem solving and design theory
			going to the pictures or a nice party
				ex: go to movie or party?
					bounded rationality conditions
						impossible to see all movies and choose the best
						meaning of good is vague
						satisficing criteria necessary
					movie evaluation
						computation costs - interact - explored solutions
							read critics
							phone friends
							expertise about actors
					party evaluation
						party is infinitely expandable concept
							unexpected expansions of initial concepts
								case 1 - movie selection
									during discussions: question remains unchanged
								case 2
									unexpected designs of what is a party can emerge from the process
								what makes it possible?
									distinguishes design from problem solving
										organize a nice party 
											simon
												it is: vague ill-structured problem
													bc: what is "nice" party?
												define problem space to form it
											design theory
												it is: clear and well formulated departure point
												apparently vague:
													allows 
														for conformity to usual
														or for innovation
													constraints
														will be investigated
									why some design problems are not real design projects
										a real design project
											if initial concepts allows for unexpected expansions
									design projects: not always creative
										simon: imagination to provide first list of actions
											then problem solving heuristics
										difficulties in this
											imagination 
												is not exogeneous to design process
												can not be triggered by designable procedures
											imagination
												can appear everywhere in proces
							design of learning devices
							social interaction as a design resource
					unexpected expansions of initial concepts

#### Managing the bots that are managing the business

	http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-the-bots-that-are-managing-the-business

Managers must become product and experience designers, deeply engaged with customers and their needs, creating services that start out as a compelling promise and get better over time the more people use them, via a “build-measure-learn” process

Workers can be “upskilled” not just by training but by software assistants that allow them to do jobs for which they were previously under-qualified.

		distinct products
			new york: 10 B
			walmart: 200K
			hunting society: 300
			mit researcher graph: 5000
		note:
			similar to that:
				we have lots of nodes in a complex organization
				how to trace the flow of information
		god complex
			my knowledge is definite
		cochrane: do patients recover at home or hospital?
			first he says: at hospital
			everybody complains:
				you are killing people, stop clinical trials
			then he says: i swapped the columns
				should we now stop clinical trials, now?
				show we close your hospitals?
		taniyama
			conjecture equivalent to fermat's last theorem
