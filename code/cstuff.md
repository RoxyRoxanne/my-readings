              cause of speed learning
                motivation and support is more important than material itself
                The high-order bit for most learning in general is not the difficulty of the material, but the support, motivation, and a healthy dose of frustration tolerance.
                make people experience "ah ha!" moment multiple times per day

      If you want to achieve your goals, don't focus on them: Reggie Rivers at TEDxCrestmoorParkED 
        goals are out of your control
        behaviours are what you can control
          focus on them
        if you focus on goals, you can't achieve them

            Adam önce internet pazarlaması yapıyor. Sonra uzaktan eğitim platformu hazırlıyor. Çok iyi ürün, fakat satış yok. Sorun şu ki, audience (takipçisi) yoktu adamın. Bu yüzden bu sefer önce blogla başlıyor. Çok detaylı araştırmalar yapıyor. 3-4 gün emek harcıyor araştırmaya. 3-4 kelimelik blog yazıları yayınlıyor, araştırmalarını özetleyen. Hackernews gibi topluluklarda bunu duyuruyor. Gelen ziyaretçilerin emaillerini topluyor. Email toplamak için ne kadar çok araç kullansan yine de az sayılmaz. Email satışın her şeyi. 
            Aylık 100 K ziyaretçiye 6 ayda ulaşıyor. Sonra siteye "servis" sekmesi koyuyor. Web tasarımı yoluyla dönüşümü yükseltelim diyor. Ancak web sitesi geliştirmek çok vakit alan bir iş. Bir senesonra, conversion konferansındaki insanlara soruyor. Bu iş nasıl yapılıyor? Fiyatlar ne? Kaç defa müşteriyle konuşuyorsunuz? Sonra conversion'a odaklanıyor. Mevcut sitelerin sadece belli kısımlarını optimize etmek. Photoshop tasarımı yapıyor, ama geliştirme işini firmaya bırakıyor.

              Ancak ciddi vakit ayır, kaliteli araştırmaya. İyi bir makale, onlarca vasat makaleden daha iyi getiri sağlar. 
              Mutlaka email topla.
              Sunacağın hizmet zaman içinde değişebilir.

      Principal Component Analysis - Explained Visually
        http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/
        aims of pca
          emphasize variation
            bring out strong patterns
        2d example
          consider: two dimensions:
            height, weight
          goal: emphasize variation
          pca finds a new coordinate system
            new axes 
              don't have physical meanings
              combinations of height and weight
              called principal components
          eliminating dimensions
            eg. x and y both have variations
              we define pc1 and pc2 st. pc1 has all variation and pc2 has minimal
              then we eliminate pc2

        work 25 min, break 5 min
          after 25 min, your learning detoriates
        learn conceptually first, then memorize facts
          try to understand to improve learning
        sleep well 8 hours
          REM makes learning long term
        take notes, review notes just after the end of study

      Lean Strategy
        http://www.bobemiliani.com/lean-strategy/
        TPS and The Toyota Way (or Lean) is a management practice for competitive buyers’ markets and is unnecessary for non-competitive sellers’ markets. If the corporate strategy is to gain leverage and control the marketplace, then most leaders would say they have no need for Lean. If they do decide there is a need for Lean, then it is seen simplistically as just another tool to increase profits or as one means that can be applied along with other means to achieve the strategy.

    A kinder, gentler philosophy of success _ Alain de Botton-MtSE4rglxbY.mp4
      why are we suffering?
        we are surrounded by snobs
          global phenomena
          anybody who takes a small part of you makes complete vision
          job snobbery: what do you do?
            someone who cares about your achievements
        ferrari driver
          not someone very greedy
          vulnerable and in need of love
        hope about our job:
          anyone can do to any position
          we arrived from caste system
          everybody is equal
          this causes: envy
        envy: dominant emotion of modern society
          linked to equality
          nobody is envy of queen of england 
          when you can relate to someone you can envy her
          closer you are, you envy more
          everybody is similar in modern society
          you can be as rich as bill gates, but it doesn't feel as that
            anyone can start from garage
          self-help section of books
            1. kind: anything is possible
            2. kind: how to cope with low self esteem
            correlation between these two
        meritocracy: cause of anxiety
          if you have talent, you work hard, you can climb to top
          by implication: if you are at the bottom, you merited and deserved
            makes failure much crushing
          middle age: poor man is unfortunate
            now: a loser
            we are responsible of our lives
        why we fear failure?
          we fear ridicule of people
          tragic art: study how people fail and feel empathy
            hamlet is not a loser but he has lost
        modern society: we don't worship anything other than ourselves
          nothing transcendental
        we can succeed in everything
          nonsense: work life success
          thing about successful life: sucked in from other people
          make sure: our ideas of success is truly our own
        impossible of justice
          randomness of success and failure
        exemplary father: tough and kinder
