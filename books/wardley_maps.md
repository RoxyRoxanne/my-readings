# Wardley Maps

## ch07: Finding a new purpose

	2007: i was unemployed
		mapping concept had two major problems
			1. failed to create anything useful with it
			2. no real evidence to support it
		evolution axis was only a pattern i observed
			data hinted components but nothing more
			maybe it was wrong
		i read more about strategy
			Rosenzweig "Halo Effect" 2007:
				managers look for ready answers
				consultants are happy to oblige
				Managers are busy people, under enormous pressure to deliver higher revenues, greater profits and ever larger returns for shareholders. They naturally search for ready-made answers, for tidy plug-and-play solutions that might give them a leg up on their rivals. And the people who write business books — consultants and business school professors and strategy gurus — are happy to oblige.
		i wanted to change this
			give people tools they need to learn themslefs
				exposing strategy to everyone
		believed there was a secret tome 
			looked for MBA
				there was no discussion of landscape or context
			looked for strategy consultancies
				entered job interview
					asked questions about user, needs, landscape
					met a wall of silence and "it is not relevant" 
					the decision was made already to take action
			made speeches in conferences
				was told: "too confusing"
				i summarized in general terms
				but it lacked any understanding of "real business"
				Paul Valery paradox:
					Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable
			general attitude: 
				copying other, 
				technology faddism, 
				buying pieces of kit rather than dealing with problems at hand
			business and IT
				they didn't understand the environment
				assumption: buying more high tech wins the day

### The new purpose

	new purpose given by others:
		explain mapping to the world of business
		to provide an uncommon sense to the common world of strategy
		first failed attempt to write a book on mapping
	how to show the concept of evolution
	my map:
		purpose: explain topographical intelligence to the world of business
		scope: demonstrate the concept of evolution
		imperative: rebel against consultants that enslave us by enabling ordinary people to learn
	chain of needs from purpose to user needs
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-54.png
	map of each user need
		map of mapping
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-55.png
			evolution axis:
				knowledge evolution: concept -> hypothesis -> theory -> accepted
			point 1:
				[User| confidence that mapping can benefit us] -> [Validation of mapping]
				[User] -> [Learn mapping]
			point 2:
				[Learn mapping] -> [Context specific gameplay]
				[Learn mapping] -> [Doctrine]
				[Learn mapping] -> [Climatic patterns| Understand common economic patterns]
				[Learn mapping] -> [Map of business landscape]
				Economic patterns are in a multitude of sources.
				But context specific gameplay is rarely covered.
			point 3:
				[Map of business landscape] -> [Value chain]
				[Map of business landscape] -> [Evolution]
				[Map of business landscape] -> [User need]
		note: my map extends into the map of my users
			any map is part of a wider chain of needs
		the chain: visible to me and my users
			/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-56.png
		evolving components
			if everybody becomes aware of mapping, then demonstrating concepts of evolution ceases to be relevant
		everything is elvvolving
			i will need to adapt my scope
				one day there will be endless guides on mapping
		balancing act between different user needs
			repeated mistake: ignoring one set of very powerful users (board and hr interview)
	
### Hypothetical Gun Company

	you are the boss of a gun company
		when market is learning industrialization of mechanical components
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-57.png
		gun manufacturer
			[Gun] -> [Gunsmith]
			[Gun] -> [Pipe]
			[Gun] -> [Bolt]
		bolt manufacturer
			[Bolt] -> [Metal ingot]
			[Bolt] -> [Armory system]
		gun company depends on bolt manufacturer
		moving towards commodity
			our desire: to keep profits high
			evolution to commodity: drives prices low
			conflict between different types of users:
				customer, business, shareholder
			how?
				branding the product
				adding new features
			conflict within your own map:
				mission: spread mapping
					makes guides to become free
					need to find other ways to monetise
		basic weakness:
			no validation of mapping at that time
				no success stories

### The trouble with maps

	"Diffusion of Innovation" Everett Rogers 1962
		how technology spreads
		over S-shaped growth
			early adopters, late adopters
		not all innovation spreads
	"Chasm" Geoffrey Moore 1991
		there is a chasm between early adopters and early majority
		many innovations fail to cross this chasm
	confusion between diffusion curves and Moore's presentation
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-58.png
		Moore: shows rates of adoption
		diffusion: is stock
	my assumption:
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-60.png
		if something crosses the chasm, then it will become a commodity
		what percentage of adoption is: chasm and commodity threshold?
		plain wrong: diffusion curve does not correspond to evolution stages
			ex: smartphones vs. gold bars
				which one is commodity?
				what is their adoption ratios?
				there is no correlation between adoption ration and evolution
			many business gurus make this mistake
				i ask them:
					"how many years take this?"
					"it is variable"
					"at what % adoption does it become commodity?
					"it is variable"
					"if it is variable both in terms of time and adoption, then how have you put a marker on a graph of time and adoption?"
		rate of diffusion is not constant
			change of evolution does not depend on adoption or time
			Christensen: an existing industry can be disrupted by new technology
				the diffusion of one thing can be substituted for another
					ex: hydralic excavators disrupted cable ones
				the same process can also be continous
					ex: same product improving
		environment looks very random and complex
			randomness of competition
			models are insufficient
			managers get l

### That first question

	what actually constitutes an innovation?
		bessemer convertor:
			process improvement for steel manufacturers
			product improvement for suppliers
		Amazon EC2:
			suppliers: new business model
			consumers: the use of computing is not new
	Rogers and Kincaid: rate of improvement changes
		it is first slow and then accelerates until a plateau of a more mature and slow improving stage
		each improved version adds definition
		eventually becoming feature complete, mature, and generally well understood
		each version reduces uncertainty about technology
	Pal Strassman: there is no correlation between IT spending and the value it created
		IT isn't one thing. it consists of many activitvies some of which create value.
	Nicholos Carr: Does IT Matter 2003
		certain aspects of IT became widespread. they have diminishing differential value and became more of a cost
	in combination:
		activities evolve through improving versions
		activities are not uniform
		characteristics of activities change as they evolve
			as they become more common, they have diminishing differential value and become more of a cost
	thus
		what if evolution consists of multiple waves of diffusion
			first innovations diffusion, second, third...
			these waver are different
	
### Uncertainty is the key

	evolution through multiple waves of diffusion
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-61.png
		first innovation: has some diffusion
		second innovation: goes beyond previous one
		...
		each version diffuses to 100% adoption of its market
	ubiquity is different for different products
		gold bars: 2%
		smartphones: 3 per each person
	Stacey Matrix: way of classifying types of agreements between groups
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-62.png
		one extreme: far from agreement + high uncertainty
		other extreme: close to agreement + high certainty
		similar to:
			people agree that a commodity is a commodity
			people disagree on what stage of evolution a less evolved component is in
		me: look for the language in the journals
		stages:
			/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-63.png
			1: wonder, such as "wonder of television"
				what are the wonders of television
			2: building, construction and awareness
				how to build your own radio
			3: operation, maintenance and feature differences
				which television is best
			4: use
				what programs to watch
		@mine:
			bu kelimeler aslında Stacey'in matrisindeki iki boyutla ilişkili:
				inovasyonun kullanımına dair bilgi kesinliği
				inovasyonun kullanımına dair insanlar arasındaki uzlaşı
		me: what is the moment when publications change from being dominated by "operations and maintenace" to "use"
			/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-64.png
			this is "point of stability"
			the product became a commodity, everyone is certain about the mature product
		point of ubiquity
			/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-65.png
			adoption ratio when point of stability occurs
	Ubiquity versus Certainty
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-66.png
		me: plot ubiquity versus certainty
		every activity followed the same path
		names for each stage:
			1: genesis 
			2: custom built
			3: product
			4: commodity
		/Users/mertnuhoglu/Dropbox/public/img/ss-67.png
	casuse of evolution journey:
		demand competition: anything useful spreads
		supply competition
	diffusion vs. evolution
		diffusion: adoption of a change
		evolution: changing nature of something
		the applicable market grows as products improve
